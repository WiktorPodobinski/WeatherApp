###WeatherApp
Simple console-based weather application that retrieves weather information for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

##Instructions

Download the project and open it in any code editor (recommend InteliJ IDEA, but also tested on VS Code with Java plugins).
Make sure you have JDK installed on your computer.
Make sure that Maven updates the files automatically for you.

After running the WeatherApp (which contains `main` class) you'll be able to input a city. You'll shortly see the information on:
- temperature
- humidity
- weather description (eg. clear sky)
- wind speed
- wind direction
- cloudiness
- UV index
- icon that represents the weather (works with InteliJ IDEA)

Please note that an active internet connection is required for the application to fetch weather data from the API.
